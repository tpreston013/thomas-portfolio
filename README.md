# thomas-portfolio

This application is a personal portfolio for Thomas Preston. The purpose is to show work samples to potential employers. The design is an attempt at mirroring the design of the mock-up example, however there are clearly many parts that need attention. 

More work is needed for links, responsive design, and positioning of many elements, especially in the body of the application.
